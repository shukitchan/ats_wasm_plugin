ATS Wasm Plugin
====
 - Check out existing POC of ATS Wasm Plugin [here](https://github.com/shukitchan/ats_tips/blob/master/wavm_wasm.md)
 - We need to leverage the latest proxy wasm SDK [here](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-sdk)
 - Add more examples on using Rust similar to information found on this [repo](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-rust-sdk)
 - Wasm modules created for envoy should be able to run on this ATS Wasm plugin as well
